# Baun

Baun is a modern, lightweight, extensible CMS for PHP. Inspired by my last CMS [Pico](http://picocms.org),
Baun has been desgined from the ground up as a modern PHP application whilst retaining the same featurs that
made Pico so popular (fast, simple, flat etc.). Baun features:

* Simple - Baun makes creating and maintaining a website as simple as editing text files
* Fast - Designed with performance in mind, and no database, making Baun blazing fast
* Flat - Baun is designed as a "flat file" CMS, meaning you can completely forget about MySQL
* Markdown - Edit your website in your favourite text editor using simple Markdown formatting
* Twig - Baun uses the [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org) templating engine, for powerful and flexible templates
* Open Source - Baun is completely free and open source, released under the MIT license
