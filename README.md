# Baun

Baun is a modern, lightweight, extensible CMS for PHP. Inspired by my last CMS [Pico](http://picocms.org),
Baun has been desgined from the ground up as a modern PHP application whilst retaining the same features that
made Pico so popular:

* **Simple** - Baun makes creating and maintaining a website as simple as editing text files
* **Fast** - Designed with performance in mind, and no database, making Baun blazing fast
* **Flat** - Baun is designed as a "flat file" CMS, meaning you can completely forget about MySQL
* **Markdown** - Edit your website in your favourite text editor using simple Markdown formatting
* **Twig** - Baun uses the Twig templating engine, for powerful and flexible templates
* **Open Source** - Baun is completely free and open source, released under the MIT license
